Essentially completely rewritten now!
Still a very work in progress piece of software at the moment.

# rekordbox-import

A tool to help import files from other DJ/Mixing software into the Rekordbox library format.

## How to use

Install NodeJS (tested on version 16) and npm. 
Clone the repository then run `npm i` to get all modules set up.
Run `npx tsc` to compile the code to javascript.
Run `node build/app.js` to run the tool.

## Todo
- Any form of user cli interface. There's nothing like it currently as it's very experimental overall.
- More supported software. Currently only Mixxx is partially supported.
- Exporting from Rekordbox into other formats.
